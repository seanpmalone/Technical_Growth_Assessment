Welcome to 'loose'

--Instructions to start the app--

1. Create an .env file in the root directory with:
"DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=yourusername
DB_PASS=yourpassword
DB_DATABASE=loose
PORT=4225"
as the content.
2. Run 'npm install' from your terminal in the root directory (you may need to install individual dependencies with 'npm install "dependency-name"').
3. Set up the mysql database with the schema.sql file by running 'mysql -u root -p < PATHNAME/schema.sql'.
4. Start the webpack by running 'npm run react-dev'.
5. Start the local server by running 'npm run server-dev'. This server is hosted on port 4225.
6. Start the socket server by running 'npm run socket'. This server is hosted on port 3000.
7. Access the app by going to 'http://localhost:4225'.

# Technical Growth Assessment

**Deadline: W7D6 12PM** 

## Format
```plaintext
I am your project manager. I want to create a real-time messaging company much like Slack. 

This prompt is intentionally left vague as these are the types of instructions you may receive in the real-world.

It is up to you to ask GOOD, clarifying questions. 
```

## Objective
### Clone Slack
- Implement a real-time chat application with a:
	- well thought out, scalable system
	- logical and optimized schema design
	- responsive && intuitive UI/UX
- Employ best practices whenever possible:
	- modular code
	- well-secured application
	- well thought out folder structure
- No restrictions on frameworks
	- Be prepared to explain your choices though!
	- Ex: React vs Angular vs Backbone

## Bare Minimum
1. Schema Design
	- Flesh out your tables and the relationships
	- Tables to consider: 
		- Teams
      - Users
      - Channels
      - Messages
      - Attachments
      - Stars
      - Reactions
      - Comments
2. System Design
3. Create a RESTful API
	- You do not need to support every type of request, just whatever is pertinent to the application
4. Integration tests for each component in your back end
	- Jest is a solid option! But explore Mocha/Chai, Jasmine, etc. 
	- You may not proceed until you write tests for each component
	- You may need to refactor some tests to accommodate certain features
5. Authentication system
	- Using Passport.js, bcrypt
	- Utilize the local strategy
		- Look into the `next()` function in Nodejs!
6. Create a socket server
	- Socket.IO
	- Mimic the functionality of Slack
		- Does not have to be exact
		- Please ask me to define 'done'
7. Design a responsive UI much like Slack
	-  Wireframes are provided by Slack's web app.
8. Deploy onto AWS EC2
	- I recommend an Ubuntu instance
		- HINT: Your goal is to install Nodejs onto the deployed Ubuntu instance

## Above and Beyond
1. Write tests for your front end code
2. Allow users to login with Google or Github
3. Secure your routes
	- Using jsonwebtoken (jwt)
		- Look into the `next()` function in Nodejs!
4. Validate your forms
	- Look into JOI! 
  - You may have to look into regex
5. Allow users to save custom emojis - store the files in AWS S3
6. Use a hosted database, either AWS RDS or AWS Dynamo
7. Secure your app with SSL
8. Use nginx as a web server to serve your static files and proxy requests!
9. Stress test your system
	- Look into artillery.io!

## God Mode
1. Port your Slack Clone to Electron

## Expectations

1. Clear concise instructions on how to start the app
	- Detail the commands I need to start my app.
	- Ensure there are no bugs when attempting to start the app.
	- I wholly expect the app to start with no problems. I should not have to debug.
2. Functional RESTful API - able to hit endpoints and retrieve data. 
	- There should be a command where I can run tests against the API!
		- Mostly expecting integration tests!
3. Achieve Slack-like functionality
	- It doesn't have to be the most scalable and perfect implementation
	- I should be able to do the following:
		- Create a Slack Team
		- Invite users to my Slack Team
		- Create channels within my Slack Team
		- Send messages to specific channels
		- Direct Message users
		- Toggle between the channels and DMs
4. UI/UX should mirror Slack's Web App
	- Again, I am not expecting perfection
	- Use your best judgment on what looks sufficient
